class Datahub():
    """
    Central data storage and management hub class.

    This class provides a singleton implementation for centralizing the data \
    structures generated across the pyanno4rt program to efficiently manage \
    and distribute information units, e.g. CT and segmentation data or \
    optimization and outcome model results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : tuple
        Tuple with optional (non-keyworded) parameters. The value ``args[0]``
        refers to the label of the treatment plan, while ``args[1]`` \
        represents an instance of `Logger` and ``args[2]`` an instance of \
        `InputChecker`. Only required for (re-)instantiating a datahub.

    Attributes
    ----------
    instances : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of treatment plan labels and associated \
        `Datahub` instances. For each unique treatment plan label, a new \
        instance of `Datahub` is generated, which can then be used across the \
        plan instance. This dictionary should NEVER be changed manually!

    label : string
        Label of the current activeÂ´ treatment plan instance.

    input_checker : object of class `InputChecker`
        Instance of the class 'InputChecker', which provides a unified \
        interface to perform input parameter checks in an extensible way.

    logger : object of class `Logger`
        Instance of the class `Logger`, which provides a pre-configured \
        instance of the logger together with the methods for outputting \
        messages to multiple streams.

    computed_tomography : dict
        Dictionary with information on the CT images.

    segmentation : dict
        Dictionary with information on the segmented structures.

    plan_configuration : dict
        Dictionary with information on the plan configuration.

    dose_information : dict
        Dictionary with information on the dose grid.

    optimization : dict
        Dictionary with information on the fluence optimization.

    datasets : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of model labels and associated external \
        datasets used for model fitting. Each dataset is a dictionary itself, \
        holding information on the raw data and the features/labels.

    feature_maps : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of model labels and associated feature maps. \
        Each feature map holds links between the features from the respective \
        dataset, the segments, and the definitions from the feature catalogue.

    model_instances : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of model labels and associated model instances, \
        i.e., the prediction model, the model configuration dictionary, and \
        the model hyperparameters obtained from hyperparameter tuning.

    model_inspections : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of model labels and associated model \
        inspectors. Each inspector holds information on the inspection \
        measures calculated.

    model_evaluations : dict
        Dictionary with pairs of model labels and associated model \
        evaluators. Each evaluator holds information on the evaluation \
        measures calculated.

    histogram : dict
        Dictionary with information on the cumulative or differential \
        dose-volume histograms for each segmented structure.

    dosimetrics : dict
        Dictionary with information on the dosimetrics for each segmented \
        structure.

        Create a new object of the class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : tuple
            Tuple with optional (non-keyworded) datahub parameters. The value \
            ``args[0]`` refers to the label of the treatment plan, while \
            ``args[1]`` represents an instance of `Logger` and ``args[2]`` an \
            instance of `InputChecker`.

        Returns
        -------
        object of class `Datahub`
            Instance of the class `Datahub`, which provides a singleton \
            implementation for centralizing the data structures generated \
            across the pyanno4rt program to efficiently manage and distribute \
            information units.

        Notes
        -----
        The ``args`` tuple is passed during the datahub initialization in the \
        treatment plan class only, i.e., the generated instance of `Datahub` \
        is appended to the ``instances`` dictionary once, and otherwise \
        fetched from the it. If ``args`` is None, and the instance for the \
        treatment plan label does not exist, a default object is returned \
        without appending to the ``instances`` dictionary.
