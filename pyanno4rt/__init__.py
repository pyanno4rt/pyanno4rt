"""
Python-based advanced numerical nonlinear optimization for radiotherapy \
(pyanno4rt) module.

==================================================================

pyanno4rt is a Python package for conventional and outcome prediction \
model-based inverse photon and proton treatment plan optimization, including \
radiobiological and machine learning (ML) models for tumor control \
probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).

This module aims to provide methods and classes for the import of patient \
data from different sources, the individual configuration and management of \
treatment plan instances, the initialization of the fluence vector by \
different strategies, multi-objective treatment plan optimization, \
data-driven outcome prediction model handling, evaluation, and visualization.

It also features an easy-to-use and clear graphical user interface.
