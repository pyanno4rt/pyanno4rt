pyanno4rt is open for new contributors of all experience levels. Please get in contact with us (see "Help and support") to discuss the format of your contribution.

Note: the "docs" folder on Github includes example files with CT/segmentation data and the photon dose-influence matrix for the TG-119 case, a standard test phantom which can be used for development. You will find more realistic patient data e.g. in the CORT dataset<sup>1</sup> or the TROTS dataset<sup>2</sup>. <br><br>
