Note: the 'docs' folder includes example files with CT, segmentation and dose-influence matrix data for an example head-and-neck patient from the CORT dataset<sup>1</sup>, which can be used for development. The example files are stored with Git Large File Storage (LFS), which you need to install before checking out the source code to be able to access them. <br><br>
