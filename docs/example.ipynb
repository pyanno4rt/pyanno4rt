    "Next, we need to describe how the treatment plan should be optimized (probably the most exciting, but also the most difficult part). In general, the final plan should apply a reasonably high dose to the planning target volumes (PTVs) while limiting the dose exposure to relevant organs at risk to prevent post-treatment complications. <br><br> To achieve this, we define objective functions for the left and right parotid glands ('PAROTID_LT' and 'PAROTID_RT'), for both PTVs ('PTV63' and 'PTV70'), and for the skin ('SKIN'), where 'Squared Overdosing' refers to a function that penalizes dose values above a maximum, and 'Squared Deviation' refers to a function that penalizes upward and downward deviations from a target. The definition of these functions is again based on a dictionary, the components dictionary: it takes the segment names from the imaging data as keys and sub-dictionaries as values, in which the component type ('objective' or 'constraint') and the component instance (or a list of instances) with the component's class name and parameters are set. <br><br> Once the components have been defined, we find ourselves in a trade-off situation, where a higher degree of fulfillment for one objective is usually accompanied with a lower degree of fulfillment for another. We can handle this by choosing the 'weighted-sum' method, which bypasses the multi-objective problem by multiplying each objective value with a weight parameter and then summing them up, effectively merging them into a scalar \"total\" objective function. This works well with the default solution algorithm, the 'L-BFGS-B' algorithm from the 'scipy' solver, so we pick that one. For the initialization of the fluence vector (holding the decision variables), we opt for 'target-coverage' to start off with a satisfactory dose level for the PTVs (alternatively we could have passed 'warm-start' and replaced None for the initial fluence vector with an array). We place a lower bound of 0 and no upper bound (None) on the fluence, matching its physical properties. As the final step, we limit the number of iterations to 500 and the tolerance (precision goal) for the objective function value to 0.001."
